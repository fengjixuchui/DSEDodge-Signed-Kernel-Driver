## Leveraging PTT to defeat DSE and run Kernel Drivers with Secure Boot Enabled

... With a Test Signing Certificate and No Extended Validation.

Code Signing is an amazing thing, But it has a glaring flaw depending on your motherboard which allows you to run Test Signed Kernel Drivers in a full trust environment with no indication to the OS that something may be wrong.

_Before you start you need to install the [Windows Driver Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)_

### 1. [Creating the Certificates](https://github.com/HypsyNZ/DSEDodge-Signed-Kernel-Driver/tree/main/CERT#readme)

To begin, we need to create our own `CA` and `SPC` and a `PFX` we can use as a `Production Certificate` later.

_You should rename these_

```ps
makecert -r -pe -n "CN=Demo_CA_Root" -ss CA -sr CurrentUser ^
   -a sha256 -cy authority -sky signature ^
   -sv Demo_CA_Root.pvk Demo_CA_Root.cer ^
   -e 02/22/2023

makecert -pe -n "CN=Demo_SPC_Code_Signing" -a sha256 -cy end ^
   -sky signature ^
   -ic Demo_CA_Root.cer -iv Demo_CA_Root.pvk ^
   -sv Demo_SPC_Code_Signing.pvk Demo_SPC_Code_Signing.cer ^
   -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3 ^
   -e 02/22/2023

pvk2pfx -pvk Demo_SPC_Code_Signing.pvk -spc Demo_SPC_Code_Signing.cer ^
   -pfx Demo_SPC_PFX.pfx ^
   -po x
```

### 3. USB Drive

Put the `Demo_SPC_Code_Signing.cer` and `Demo_CA_Root.cer` Certificate onto a USB stick, we are going to import the Certificates into the `BIOS` so the Kernel will trust our `Signature` and install/run our driver as if Microsoft had signed it themselves.

### 4. Restart PC and Enter the Bios

_(These steps may vary slightly depending on your BIOS but the concept is the same)_

Select the `Secure Boot Menu` in your Bios

In the `Key Management` section select `Authorized Signatures` (Or wherever the `Microsoft Production PCA Certificate` is located)

Select `Append/Add` from the Menu that pops up

Locate `Demo_SPC_Code_Signing.cer` and `Demo_CA_Root.cer` on your `USB`, pressing enter twice when selecting them.

The second time you press enter you'll be prompted to confirm you want to update the Certificate Store, Select `Yes`.

### 5. Success, We are now an "Extended Validator" on this PC.

The certificates you just added to the `BIOS` can now be used for "Extended Validation" of Kernel Drivers without using any exploits, essentially bypassing Driver Signing Enforcement (DSE) because there is no third party involved and you just sign it yourself without the extra steps.

### 6. Trust the CA Certificate

Restart the computer and open the `Demo_CA_Root.cer` certificate

Install the certificate to the `Trusted Root` of the `Local Machine`

Now drivers signed by `Demo_SPC_PFX.pfx` will be trusted.

### 7. BUILDING THE DRIVER

Now you can Production Sign your driver instead of Test Signing

`Demo_SPC_Code_Signing.cer` is the `Cross-Signing Certificate`

`Demo_SPC_PFX.pfx` is the `Production Certificate`

### 7. CREATE AND SIGN THE SECURITY CATALOG / TIMESTAMP DRIVER

DSE will stop us from installing the Kernel Driver if the catalog isn't signed correctly, manually run these commands.

```cmd
inf2cat /os:10_x64 /driver:.\x64\Release /uselocaltime

SignTool sign /fd sha256 /td SHA256 /tr "http://sha256timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha256/timestamp" /f .\CERT\Demo_SPC_PFX.pfx /p x /v .\x64\Release\KMDFDriver\kmdfdriver.cat

SignTool sign /fd sha256 /td SHA256 /tr "http://sha256timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha256/timestamp" /f .\CERT\Demo_SPC_PFX.pfx /p x /v .\x64\Release\KMDFDriver\KMDFDriver.sys

```

### 8. Install your Driver

Now you can install and run your driver without configuring [BCEDIT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/the-testsigning-boot-configuration-option)

### 9. Run your Driver

With your `CA Root Certificate` in `Authorized Signatures` in the `BIOS` the Kernel won't stop your Driver from running and you can make `Production Certificates` whenever you want for use on your own PC.

Tested on a motherboard with the `Z490 Chipset`

OS: [`Windows 10 Professional - Full Strip & Lockdown Edition - 21H2`](https://github.com/HypsyNZ/ISOKIT/tree/master/21H2)

This may not work on earlier chipsets, It may be removed in later ones.

Whether this works or not totally depends on your Motherboard/CPU combination.

#### Have Fun and remember, GÃ¶del's theorem suggests certain information can travel faster than the speed of light.

# Related Project

[Custom Kernel Signers](https://github.com/HyperSine/Windows10-CustomKernelSigners)

This project works in a similar way and depending on your motherboard/situation it may be the better option, Some motherboards don't let you add `Authorized Signatures` directly in the `BIOS`

Some motherboards allow you to have more than one `Platform Key` but if you can add `Authorized Signatures` it doesn't matter anyway.

# Caution

If you delete certificates and then leave your `BIOS` without saving changes (Power cut etc) you will brick your motherboard and have to flash it without any menus. (QFLASH)
